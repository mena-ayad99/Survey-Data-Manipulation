# Survey Monkey Data Manipulation


**Part of series of projects to build my portfolio and practice the skills I learned.**

In this project, a data obtained from Survey monkey needed to be restructured from wide to long format and then add some extra columns to make the data set suitable for visualization


Project stages:
* Initial manipulating and edit of columns name using Excel.
* Importing the data into Visual CS to start analysis.
* Data exploring, cleaning and restructuring the data ( using the melt method).
* Finally series of group by and merge to add numeric responses to the data to make visualization easier

Initial data format: 198 row * 104 col
Final data format: 17028 row * 13 col


Tools: Visual CS, Pandas, Excel.
